k-means++ is an algorithm for choosing the initial values (or "seeds") for the k-means clustering algorithm.

The exact algorithm is as follows:

- Choose one center uniformly at random among the data points.
- For each data point x, compute D(x), the distance between x
    and the nearest center that has already been chosen.
- Choose one new data point at random as a new center, using 
    a weighted probability distribution where a point x is
    chosen with probability proportional to D(x)2.
- Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until k centers have been chosen.
- Now that the initial centers have been chosen, proceed using 
    standard k-means clustering.
